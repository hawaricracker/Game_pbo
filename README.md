# ZWOMBIE SLWAYER: A GWAM THAT’S PWURELY CWURSED

Konnichi-wha, fellow netizens of the interwebs! Welcome to the *Zwombie Slwayer* repo, a digital dumpster fire we slapped together ‘cause our dosen went full *Saitama-sensei* and punched us with a deadline. This ain’t a gwaem, it’s a *gwaemocalypse*—a half-baked zombie-slaying mess running on enjwin tech we don’t even understand. Four wibu gremlins made this while chugging ramune and crying over *JoJo* spoilers. DON’T DWOWNLOAD THIS, UNLESS YOU WANNA SUMMON A DIGITAL STANDO THAT EATS YOUR RAM.

## Our Chaotic Party of Misfits
We’re a squad of sleep-deprived weebs who’d rather be farming primogems in *Genshin* than touching this repo. Meet the culprits:

- **notnyxun** (Self-Proclaimed Shogun of Kwode)  
  Tugas: Smashing kwode together like a *Konosuba* spell gone wrong.  
  Nyeleneh Fact: Claims he channels *Giorno Giovanna*’s spirit to debug, but just spams `print("ORA")`. Loves yelling “BWOKCHAIN!” when the server crashes.  

- **theycallmeshan** (Spwite Sorceress)  
  Tugas: Drew zwombie spwites that look like *Pikachu* got lost in *Tokyo Ghoul*.  
  Nyeleneh Fact: Swears her art is “bwushstroke kawaii,” but it’s just MS Paint with extra glitter. Dreams of yeeting this project into the *Hunter x Hunter* chimera ant arc.  

- **fawujann** (Bug Bwuster Who Bwusts Nothing)  
  Tugas: Supposed to fix bugs, but just vibes to *One Punch Man* OST and calls it “testing.”  
  Nyeleneh Fact: Thinks “enjwin” is powered by *ramen noods* and once tried to “bwokchain” the kwode for “security.” Spoiler: It didn’t work.  

- **hawaricracker** (Doku-Master of Excuses)  
  Task: Wrote this README and invented reasons why our gwaem is “avant-garde.”  
  Nyeleneh Fact: Believes she’s the protagonist of a *slice-of-life* anime but stuck in this *Berserk*-level nightmare. Calls deadlines “final boss energy.”

## W-What Even Is This Gwaem?
*Zwombie Slwayer* is… uh, a thing where you, like, *bwap* zwombies with a katana or something. We built it on a frankenstein’d enjwin (we think it’s *Unwity* or *Gowdot*, who cares). The story? Post-apockalyptic world, zwombies everywhere, you’re the chosen *shounen* hero… or maybe just a side character, idk. The kwode’s held together by *bwokchain*-level duct tape, and the spwites? Let’s just say they’re *uniquely cursed* like a *Monogatari* arc gone rogue.

## Why You Should RUN From This Repo
1. It’s not a gwaem, it’s a *digital yandere* that’ll crash your PC and whisper “NOTICE ME, SENPAI.”
2. Our kwode is like *Gundam Unicorn*’s plot: nobody understands it, not even us.
3. Bugs? More like *Stando* attacks that’ll ZA WARUDO your sanity.
4. We’d rather be simping for *Zhongli* or debating *waifu* tiers on X than fixing this.

## Final Wibbly-Wobbly Words
If you’re crazy enough to clone this repo, prepare for a *JoJo*-level bizarre adventure with no happy ending. Mending rewatch *Kubo Won’t Let Me Be Invisible* or scroll X for *Anya* memes. Sayonara, and may your sanity survive this *bwokchain* of chaos!
